## Project Overview :round_pushpin:
This interactive image gallery was built to practice core JavaScript skills, along with HTML and CSS. The gallery showcases Christmas-themed movies, organized into three main categories (e.g. Classics, Family Favorites, and Rom-Coms). Clicking on an image will enlarge it in a lightbox-style view, allowing users to scroll through the full collection interactively.

This project helped me understand how to use JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic gallery functionality.

## Tech Stack :computer:
* **HTML5**- for semantic page structure
- **CSS3**- for styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**- for interactivity and user experience

## Features :wrench:
* **Category-Based Gallery**: Movies are grouped into thematic sections
- **Image Enlargement**: Clicking on a movie poster opens it in an enlarged view
- **Scroll Navigation**: Users can scroll through images within the enlarged window

 ## Learning Objectives :brain: 
 * Practive writing and organizing JavaScript functions
- Understand event listeners and DOM traversal
- Build a basic lightbox-style modal using JavaScript
- Improve skills in CSS layout and image presentation
